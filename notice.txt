jthread is only supported by c++ 20, so designate the version when compling if you want to use jthread
conmand line: g++ -std=c++20 -pthread play_thread.cpp -o play_thread

Launch a static server
(just a simple http server to serve static resource files from a local directory
 unable to handle dynamic requests such as CRUD operations):
python -m http.server 8000

To realize a biconditional-communication between client and server:
1. Custom the BaseHTTPRequestHandler.
2. Design a service supporting GET/POST.
3. The client use fetch('http://localhost:8000/something') to call the server.
